# Enhancement

## Behavior

* Make enharmonically identical intervals not being able to be simultaneously selected at once (such as major third and diminished fourth). Use ```seesaw.binding```

* Add root note in the chords description. The atom may be completed deleted as the value of chords qualities and root note could be only retrieved from listboxes values

* Allow a play button to hear chords and show which notes compose the chord

* Make a mobile application version

## Hot topics

* Drop the atom and solely rely on comboboxes values in order to simplify the listening process
