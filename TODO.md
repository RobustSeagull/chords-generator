# Enhancement

## Behavior

* Make enharmonically identical intervals not being able to be simultaneously selected at once (such as major third and diminished fourth). Use ```seesaw.binding```

* Allow a play button to hear chords and show which notes compose the chord

* Make a mobile application version

## Issues

* In ```scales/computing.clj```, issues with ```case``` functions; matching close problems

* At run-time: when root have been selected, and when the scale degrees are modified, the root note is reinitialized
